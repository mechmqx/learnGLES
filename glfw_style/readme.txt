1. the project is constructed on deepin system at home. the glfw lib is build on the platform. so, when download the project into ubuntu system at fatory, build error(in fact link error) occur.
    how to fix it: down the glfw lib from https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git and build locally and use the new glfw lib replace the previous lib.
